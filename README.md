### Feature:

- An unusual design system with music equipment as its theme.
- Web-optimized layout designed with a grid system like Bootstrap 5.
- Verify feasibility from both WEB API and design, and update each other daily.

### This project uses:

- React.js
- TypeScript
- Figma
- Storybook

## Previews


### Web Preview

※ Currently in preparation  
**※ Each part is created with responsive design in mind, but the layout of the app itself is created with the assumption that it will be used at 992px or higher.**

### Colors

I think about color in three steps.

The first is like a color palette. All colors used in the design are limited to these.

(Irregulars also exist. For example, if you want to add a Twitter icon, it's a special color that is excluded from this world.)

The second is "role colors".  
For example, in flashing lights, it is very useful to indicate its status.

The third are for design parts.  
These are only partially shown as more specific color schemes can be referenced from the actual parts.


## Roadmap to Version 0.1.0

1. Rough Design & Coding (with Figma & React) **<=== NOW!!**
2. Examining color schemes and design tokens  (with Figma)
3. Create components for primary design parts (with Figma)
4. Create React Components (with React)
5. Two-way brush-up of Figma and React designs
6. Publish Figma files as Figma template

※Until version 0.1.0, I will do destructive editing.
